        <p> <strong>The problem </strong> <br>
          The first iteration of the Beacon SDK by Help Scout focused on getting 
          the core functionality found in its web counterpart: 
          self-service and message sending, into a mobile-friendly build. What it lacked, however, 
          was a primary focus on the mobile experience.
          Some design patterns were taken from the web that did not 
          quite gel with a mobile user's expectations. I worked on making the 
          transition to a more native feel, while reworking the UX and the UI.</p>

          Users have come to expect specific design patterns 
          when using their phones, even if they aren't aware of it. 
          Searching is generally at the top; swiping left takes you back. 
          All ingrained into us through repetition.
