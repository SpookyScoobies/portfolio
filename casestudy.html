        <p>Creating a recipe <br>
          The main feature of this project was to allow the user to publish their recipe on the Kitchen Stories platform through a series of steps. 
          The creation process was designed so that the output would be in the same format as existing Kitchen Stories recipes. </p>

        <p> Author Attributes <br>
          Prior to launch, dish tiles had no assigned author because all recipes were simply developed by the in-house test kitchen. With user recipes now being added to the mix, there was a need to give credit to authors and differentiate recipes 
          that are by Kitchen Stories, brand partners and the community of users.   </p>
